# 2.2. Values and Data Types
# 3. **Exercise:**
#    - Write a program that:
#      - Assigns different values to variables.
#      - Prints the type of each variable.

# Assigning different values to variables
x = 42        # Integer
y = 3.14      # Float
z = "Hello"   # String
a = True      # Boolean
b = [1, 2, 3] # List
c = (4, 5, 6) # Tuple
d = {7, 8, 9} # Set
e = {"key": "value"} # Dictionary
f = None      # NoneType

# Printing the type of each variable
print(type(x), type(y), type(z))
print(type(a), type(b), type(c))
print(type(d), type(e), type(f))






# 2.3. Operators and Operands
# 3. **Exercise:**
#    - Create a Python script that demonstrates:
#      - Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
#      - Comparisons between numbers.
#      - Logical operations like `and`, `or`, `not`.

# Arithmetic Operations
a = 10
b = 5

addition = a + b
subtraction = a - b
multiplication = a * b
division = a / b

print("Addition:", addition)
print("Subtraction:", subtraction)
print("Multiplication:", multiplication)
print("Division:", division)

# Comparison Operations
print("a is equal to b:", a == b)
print("a is not equal to b:", a != b)
print("a is greater than b:", a > b)
print("a is less than b:", a < b)
print("a is greater than or equal to b:", a >= b)
print("a is less than or equal to b:", a <= b)

# Logical Operations
x = True
y = False

print("x AND y:", x and y)
print("x OR y:", x or y)
print("NOT x:", not x)
